# Titanic Death Rate Data Analysis
### DATA 2401 Data Science Final Project performing data exploration, visualization and analysis

While in route to the United States in April of 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg causing passengers to flea towards a limited number of lifeboats. The ship ultimately submerged under water less than three hours after the iceberg struck the ship. An estimated 2,224 people were on board the Titanic, over 1,500 of whom perished. The purpose of this project is to analyze and explore the pattern of these deaths and how they are distributed among class, gender, and age aboard the Titanic. The data being used contains passenger information while outlining who survived. As relationships between certain variables and death rates are established, visualizations will be produced to illustrate them. The problem statement will be addressed using techniques and tools that can be found in the R language and its library packages.
